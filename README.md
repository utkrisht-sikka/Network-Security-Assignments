# Network-Security-Assignments
These are my submissions for all 4 assignments of CSE350 Network Security course.

# Key Highlights
1. In A1, I encrypted 5 plaintexts with poly-alphabetic substitution cipher. Also, launched a brute force attack to discover the key.

2. In A2, built 16 rounds of DES system from scratch. 

3. In A3, coded a RSA based public-key Certification Authority to securely supply public keys. This facilitated confidential exchange messages between clients. 

4. In A4, I construct a web server that responds with degree and grade sheet of client. The documents are digitally signed by authorities, with water mark, and ensured that only the graduate student is able to access it
